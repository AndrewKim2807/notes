## DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
**Descriptive Statistics** summarize and organize characteristics of a dataset. Basically it helps us see what's most common and how spread out our stuff is, like counting your favourite colored toy cars and seeing there are more red ones than blue ones. In quantitive research, after collecting data, the first step of statistical analysis is to describe characteristics of the responses, such as the average of one variable (e.g., age), or the relation between 2 varibles (e.g., age and creativity).
